		In this chapter we ae going to be covering the basic requirements for testing Web applications in Ruby, Java and DotNet.
		Ruby is up first. Jump ahead to the language of your choice if you are in a hurry.

			<p>
				If you are at all serious about using cucumber to test Rails sites, then you should get hold of the RSpec Book <bib ref="chelimsky:rspec" />, which
				includes a section discussing BDD outside-in rails development using cucumber in great detail. We will, however, give a very brief overview of the
				basics for Rails 2 here.
			</p>
			<p>
				To use cucumber with rails, you will need the following gems installed on your system:
				<ul>
					<li>rails </li>
					<li>cucumber</li>
					<li>cucumber-rails</li>
					<li>rspec-rails</li>
					<li>webrat</li>
					<li>selenium-client</li>
				</ul>
				Install each of these using ruby gems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have these installed, get things running using the following commands:
			</p>
			<code>
				rails ninjas4Hire
				cd ninjas4Hire
				script/generate rspec
				script/generate cucumber --webrat --rspec
			</code>
			<p>
				You should now be able to run cucumber tests using the command:
			</p>
			<code>rake cucumber</code>
			<p>
				... and get a response like this:
			</p>
			<code>
				0 scenarios
				0 steps

		<section title="Sinatra">
			<p>
				Due to the fact that Ninjas like to travel light (Their deep appreciation of 20th century easy listening crooners is also a factor)
				we will be using Sinatra<footnote><url link="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro"/></footnote> to illustrate how to use cucumber to support web application development.
			</p>
			<sidebar title="What is Sinatra, Daddio?" id="sidebar.sinatra">
				<p>
					Sinatra is a lightweight framework for creating web applications using Ruby.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an example, the following is given for a helloworld example on the Sinatra site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Create a ruby file called myapp.rb:
				</p>
				<code>
					# myapp.rb
					require 'sinatra'

					get '/' do
						'Hello world!'
					end
				</code>
