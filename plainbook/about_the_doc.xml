<preface id="pre_about" title="About this document">
	<p>This document is a step-by-step guide for Cucumber,
	a tool that is quickly becoming the weapon of choice for many agile teams when it comes to functional test automation, creating
	executable specifications and building a living documentation. We believe in iterative development so we write iteratively and this
	is just the start: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>This version
	covers the basics of setting up Cucumber for Ruby, Java and .NET and how to write and design good tests. </li>
	<li>The second version will cover integration with web test automation frameworks.</li>
	<li>The third version will have more examples on Ajax and cover advanced web automation topics.</li>
	</ul>
